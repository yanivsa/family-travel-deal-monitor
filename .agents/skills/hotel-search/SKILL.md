# Hotel Search

## Overview

Two endpoints on the hotels REST API answer almost every accommodation question: `POST /search` for "what can I stay in at this destination", and `POST /hotel_by_name` for "is this exact property available and what does it cost". Use `travel-data-api` for auth, base URL, and endpoint details; prefer the hosted MCP tools when a client is configured, and otherwise run hotel work over REST with the RapidAPI header pair. Response fields you will actually see are `properties[].name`, `price`, `price_string`, `review_score`, `review_count`, `room_type`, `location`, `image_url`, `link` from `/search`, and `name`, `available`, `price`, `price_string`, `review_score`, `review_count`, `room_type`, `image_url`, `link`, `nights`, `adults`, `children` from `/hotel_by_name`.

## Endpoints

| Job the user has | Endpoint | Required | Optional |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Find me a hotel in X" | `POST /search` | `destination` (free text), `checkin_date`, `checkout_date` (YYYY-MM-DD) | `adults` (default 2), `children` (default 0), `currency` (default `USD`), `budget_per_night`, `proxy_country` (two-letter code), `filters[]` |
| "Is the Hotel X available / how much?" | `POST /hotel_by_name` | `hotel_name`, `checkin_date`, `checkout_date` | `area` (disambiguates generic names), `adults`, `children`, `currency`, `proxy_country`, `free_cancellation` |

Host: `booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com`. Both endpoints are `POST` with a JSON body.

## Workflow

1. Decide which endpoint the question is. A named property ("the Gracery Shinjuku", "Hilton Midtown") is `/hotel_by_name`. Anything shaped like a destination, area, or "somewhere near X" is `/search`.
2. Pin down dates before calling. Both endpoints require `checkin_date` and `checkout_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD`. If the user said "three nights in September", ask or state the dates you assumed — do not guess silently, because a wrong date is a wasted billed request.
3. Translate the user's soft constraints into hard parameters. "Under $200 a night" is `budget_per_night`, "4-star with good reviews and free cancellation" is `filters: ["stars_4", "review_score_8", "free_cancellation"]`. Only send filters the user actually implied; each one narrows the result set.
4. For `/hotel_by_name`, always send `area` when the name is generic ("Hilton", "Ibis Budget", "Grand Hotel"). Without it the API can match a same-named property in another city.
5. Read the result honestly. An empty `properties` array and `available: false` are both valid answers, not errors — see Common Pitfalls. Report the price with the timestamp of the call.

## Search a Destination

```bash
export RAPIDAPI_KEY="YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY"

curl -sS -X POST "https://booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com/search" \
  -H "x-rapidapi-key: $RAPIDAPI_KEY" \
  -H "x-rapidapi-host: booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "destination": "Tokyo Shibuya",
    "checkin_date": "2026-09-12",
    "checkout_date": "2026-09-15",
    "adults": 2,
    "children": 0,
    "currency": "USD",
    "budget_per_night": 220,
    "filters": ["stars_4", "review_score_8", "free_cancellation"]
  }'
```

The response echoes `destination`, `checkin_date`, `checkout_date`, `applied_filters`, and `budget_per_night` alongside `properties[]` — check `applied_filters` to confirm the constraints you meant to apply were the ones the API used.

## Price a Named Hotel

```bash
export RAPIDAPI_KEY="YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY"

curl -sS -X POST "https://booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com/hotel_by_name" \
  -H "x-rapidapi-key: $RAPIDAPI_KEY" \
  -H "x-rapidapi-host: booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "hotel_name": "Hotel Gracery Shinjuku",
    "area": "Tokyo",
    "checkin_date": "2026-09-12",
    "checkout_date": "2026-09-15",
    "adults": 2,
    "currency": "USD",
    "free_cancellation": true
  }'
```

`nights` in the response is the length of the stay the quote covers, and `adults` / `children` echo the occupancy that was priced — check them against what the user asked for. Report `price_string` exactly as it comes back rather than deriving a per-night or total figure the response does not state.

## Filters

`filters` is an array of strings on `POST /search`. These are the only accepted values:

| Category | Values |
|---|---|
| Cancellation and payment | `free_cancellation`, `accepts_online_payment` |
| Meals | `breakfast_included`, `breakfast_and_lunch`, `breakfast_and_dinner`, `all_meals_included`, `all_inclusive`, `very_good_breakfast` |
| Star rating | `stars_3`, `stars_4`, `stars_5` |
| Review score | `review_score_7`, `review_score_8`, `review_score_9` |
| Amenities | `free_wifi`, `swimming_pool`, `gym`, `parking`, `front_desk_24h`, `private_bathroom`, `air_conditioning`, `sauna` |
| Property policy | `pets_allowed`, `adults_only` |

Anything not on this list will not work — do not invent filter names such as `spa` or `beachfront`. Note `free_cancellation` is a filter value on `/search` but a standalone optional boolean parameter on `/hotel_by_name`.

## Repeat Searches Across a Shortlist

Neither `POST /search` nor `POST /hotel_by_name` takes a batch parameter, so with these two endpoints a shortlist of named properties is one call per property. Loop them, and tell the user the call count before you start.

```bash
export RAPIDAPI_KEY="YOUR_RAPIDAPI_KEY"

for HOTEL in "Hotel Gracery Shinjuku" "Shibuya Stream Excel Hotel Tokyu" "Cerulean Tower Tokyu Hotel"; do
  curl -sS -X POST "https://booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com/hotel_by_name" \
    -H "x-rapidapi-key: $RAPIDAPI_KEY" \
    -H "x-rapidapi-host: booking-live-api.p.rapidapi.com" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "$(printf '{"hotel_name":"%s","area":"Tokyo","checkin_date":"2026-09-12","checkout_date":"2026-09-15","adults":2}' "$HOTEL")"
done
```

The same shape applies to comparing date windows or currencies: vary one field per call, and count the calls out loud first.

## Common Pitfalls

- **An empty result is an answer, not an error.** `POST /search` returning `properties: []` on HTTP 200 means nothing at that destination matched those dates, that `budget_per_night`, and those `filters`. Do not retry the identical call. Say what came back empty, then offer to drop the tightest constraint (usually `budget_per_night` or a `stars_5` / `review_score_9` filter) and search again — that is a second billed request, so ask first.
- **A sold-out hotel is `available: false` with null prices, and that is valid.** `POST /hotel_by_name` returns `available: false` and null `price` / `price_string` when the property has no rooms for those dates. Report "no availability on those dates" plainly. Do not call it a failure, do not retry, and do not fall back to quoting a price you saw earlier.
- **Every parameter combination is a separate billed request.** Three properties × two date windows is six calls of the user's money. State the cost before making the calls, never after. This applies to `proxy_country` comparisons and currency sweeps too. One call per country is not a country comparison: rates move between identical calls, so each country needs several samples. Hand that job to `rate-parity-monitor`.
- **Never reuse or cache a rate.** Hotel prices and availability go stale in minutes. Every price you present must come from the call you just made, with the time it was fetched attached. If a rate came from earlier in the conversation, re-fetch it rather than repeating it.
- **If the same trip also needs flights** (hand that work to the flight skills, but do not be surprised by these): an empty flight result is only "no flights" when the response header `X-Search-Status` says `ok` or `empty` — `degraded` means the search did not complete and says nothing about availability. `use_fallback` is accepted but currently has no effect on a search.

## Output Standards

- Lead with the answer to the question asked — the two or three properties that fit the stated budget and constraints, each with `price_string`, `review_score` out of the `review_count`, `room_type`, and the booking `link` — then offer the full list. Always state when the prices were fetched, and treat every quote as indicative until the user opens the link; a rate is not booked until Booking.com confirms it.
- Say what you filtered on and what you assumed (dates, `adults`, `currency`), so the user can correct a wrong assumption before paying for another search. This is an independent API that returns publicly available flight and hotel pricing; it is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Google or Booking.com — say so whenever a reader could assume the results are an official Booking.com channel.
